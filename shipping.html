    <h1>Shipping & Fulfillment</h1>

    <p>
      At Époque Labs, fulfillment is handled with care, precision, and intention.
      Orders are processed only after products have completed quality review and
      are prepared for dispatch.
    </p>

    <h2>Processing Time</h2>
    <p>
      Orders are typically <strong>dispatched within 24–48 business hours</strong>.
      If additional time is required, you will be notified proactively.
    </p>

    <h2>Shipping Confirmation</h2>
    <p>
      Tracking information is provided once your order has been packaged
      and staged for carrier pickup.
    </p>

    <h2>Delays</h2>
    <p>
      In the event of a delay, we communicate clearly and promptly with
      updated timelines.
    </p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>

      upon request.
